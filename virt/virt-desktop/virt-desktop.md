## What do we mean?

- Running VMs on your laptop or desktop machine with keyboard and screen
- Especially useful for:
  - Trying out other operating systems
  - Development and test environments (sandboxes)
  - Running foreign applications

---

## Things we like

- Simple to use GUI
- Features
  - Represent the guest's console as a window
  - Easy use of keyboard and mouse
  - Copy-paste between the guest and the hostâ€“Disk image management and snapshots
- We are not worried about datacentre-grade scalability

- a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use

## Why VirtualBox?

- Pros:
  - Free\* and Open Source (GPL)\*
  - Available for Windows, Mac, Linux, FreeBSD
  - Good documentation
  - Easy to use and powerful
  - Can run 64-bit guests on 32-bit host (with VT-x)
- Cons:
  - It's owned by Oracle

> Except the optional Extension Pack, which is closed source, free for personal use only

## Things you need to know

- Default disk image format is "VDI" and you can choose either fixed or growable
- The default networking mode is "NAT" and you don't need to configure anything
  - Client will pick up IP address (10.0.2.15) via DHCP and can make outbound connections
- The full manual is included (Help > Contents) or you can download it separately

---

## Things you need to know (2)

- Click in the guest window to capture the keyboard and mouse
- **To release the keyboard and mouse, press the "_host key_" which is usually _Right Ctrl_**
- You can get better keyboard/mouse integration by installing the "VBox Guest Additions"
  - Then you can simply move your mouse over the window and move it away again
  - Also lets you copy-paste and share files with the guest

---

## Practical exercise

- Install VirtualBox on your laptop
  - if you have more than 1GB RAM and more than 5GB free hard drive space
- Create a VM and install Ubuntu within it
- If you have time: install the VirtualBox Guest Additions and more VMs
